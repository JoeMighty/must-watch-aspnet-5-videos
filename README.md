# Must watch ASP.NET 5 / MVC videos

With all of the great work the .NET guys have been doing lately and the release of ASP.NET 5 just around the corner I've composed a collection of must watch videos that I've been recommended or found.

If I've missed any then please feel free to add them to the list!

**Note:** As ASP.NET 5 and MVC 6 are still under development some of the content/apis within the videos may have changed.
